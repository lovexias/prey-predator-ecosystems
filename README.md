# Async Learning Task: Prey-Predator Ecosystems
## by CMPLXSY S19 Group 10

The group chose to model a **fox-rabbit ecosystem** where foxes (predators) hunt rabbits (prey) in a grass environment regenerating grass blocks over time. The cyclic environment has the prey and predators influencing each other's population through predation and reproduction.

**Rabbits** move randomly and consume grass to replenish their energy. They reproduce when they have enough energy, and their energy decreases as they move. If their energy runs out or they exceed their lifespan of 100 weeks, they die.

**Foxes** hunt rabbits for food to restore their energy. They move randomly, reproduce when they have enough energy, and their energy decreases as they move. If their energy runs out or they exceed their lifespan of 150 weeks, they die.

**Grass** grows on patches in the environment. When consumed by rabbits, it regrows after a set time. The availability of grass influences the rabbit population's survival and reproduction.

This simple prey-predator model helps visualize how interactions between prey and predators regulate ecosystem dynamics over time.
